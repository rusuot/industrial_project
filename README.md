# CRUD-API-FIREBASE
This is work in progress.

CRUD APIs can be found in index.js
There is: GET products, GET product by name, POST (=create) product, UPDATE product & DELETE product.

What needs to be done more: establish for each product what fields are required, at this moment for test sake I've put only anme & status. I'll update to have: id, description, price..
All APIs were tested via POSTMAN and when called they return status 200 OK (=success), and they are succesfully added in the database.

As I'll advance with the work I'll add next commits.
